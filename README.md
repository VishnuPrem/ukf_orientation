# Unscented Kalman Filter for estimating orientation
Unscented kalman filter implemented for estimating the roll, pitch and yaw of a body given measurement from an IMU. The UKF implementation is based on the paper titled ["A quaternion-based unscented Kalman filter for orientation tracking"](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/A-quaternion-based-unscented-Kalman-filter-for-Kraft/2d211ba91a30f9ece9eef098a009a4e1465c8c44?p2df).
